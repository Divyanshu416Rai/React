//REACT :React JS is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs), especially for single-page applications (SPAs) where performance and dynamic updates are important.

//Framework : A framework is a pre-defined structure or platform that provides a foundation for developing software applications. It gives you a set of tools, rules, and guidelines so you can build and organize your project more easily

//Virtual Dom :The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory copy of the real DOM (Document Object Model). React uses it to track changes and update the UI efficiently.
